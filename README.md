# Undergrad Android App Development Project

This repository contains the files for a **personal Android application development project** completed during my undergraduate studies in 2017.

---

## Project Context

The primary purpose of this project was to **fulfill my Bachelor’s degree requirement**.  
As such, the design and implementation are **academic in nature** and are not intended to demonstrate full industry-level sophistication.

That said, this project is included here to provide evidence of foundational software development skills and independent learning ability.

## Interpretation of This Repository

Despite the primary academic purpose of the project, **this repository aims to demonstrate my following skills**:

### 1. Programming with Java
- The application is primarily implemented in **Java**
- Core Android development concepts are applied throughout the project

### 2. Integration of Third-Party SDKs
- **Bmob SDK** is used to store and manage registered user data  
  https://www.bmobapp.com/
- **Easemob SDK** is integrated to provide instant messaging functionality  
  https://www.easemob.com/

### 3. Application Architecture Planning & Implementation
- The overall application architecture was **designed and implemented independently**
- Includes interface control and data handling for:
  - user registration and login
  - instant messaging
  - feed-style content

### 4. Use of Data Structures and Algorithms
- User data, feed data, and contact data are managed using **fundamental data structures and algorithms**
- Display logic and interaction flows are implemented based on these structures

### 5. Self-Learning Capability
- Android development skills were acquired through **self-directed learning** using online resources
- Built upon prior academic training in **Java programming and data structures**
